List of further plugins to enchange stuff: 
- use vi mode following this [link](https://www.barbarianmeetscoding.com/blog/5-minutes-vim-enabling-vim-in-zsh)
** alot of terminal hacks are explaied here https://andrew.cloud/blog/dev-setup/
-https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts#option-4-homebrew-fonts for exa icons
- exa to replace ls
- bat to replace cat
- fd to replace find (fuzzy search)
- htop to inspect performace


Some painpoints that still exists: 
- cannot use vim commands to edit vims :term commands. I only focus on the end of the input command, not where the cursor is. So the solution here is to try to use harpoon to write most commenly used commands and limit the writing in the .term. see issue at [github](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/8805)
