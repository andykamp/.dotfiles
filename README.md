# .dotfiles

**Goal**: Super fast terminal based dev environment 

**Worfklow**:
- go to places i visit less often
    -  could use fuzzy finder
- go to places i go to all the time
    - would expect single key-stroke to get there
- go into editing 

**Must have plugins to note:**
- fzf (for zsh) 
- telescope
- harpoon
- vim-fugitive
- easy-motion

Yabai:
- read https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/wiki/Disabling-System-Integrity-Protection
- inspired by https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYsCAOfGjxE
- start yabai and skhd by:
    - brew services start yabai / brew services stop yabai
    - brew services start skhd
    - brew services stop skhd
- make symlink to dotfiles 
    - ln -s ~/dotfiles/.yabairc ~/.yabairc
    - ln -s ~/dotfiles/.skhdrc ~/.skhdrc

**Note**: Remember that most dotfiles har a place somewhere. Make sure they point/symlink to the links inside this dotfile repo. 
Use the `ln -s <actual existing filepath> <this will point to existing file filepath>` to create a symlink
This must be done for (might be missing some):
- nvim (located in ~/.config/nvim)
- vimrc
- zshrc
- .zsh_profile
- alacritty.yml (located in ~/.config/alacritty)
    - ln -s ~/.dotfiles/alacritty ~/.config/alacritty
- fish (located in ~/.config/fish)
    - ln -s ~/dotfiles/fish/ ~/.config/fish 
- starfish (located in ~/.config/starfish.toml)
    - ln -s ~/dotfiles/staship.toml ~/.config/starship.toml
- neofetch (located in  ~/.config/neofetch/config.conf)
    - ln -s ~/dotfiles/neofetch ~/.config/neofetch 
Also for ll scrips/executable u need to make it executble and giev u access
`chmod u+x filepath`
- make sure to remap capslock to control 



## üôá Worth remembering
- terminal commands and replacements descibed [here](https://andrew.cloud/blog/dev-setup/)
- exa to replace ls
- bat to replace cat
- fd to replace find (fuzzy search)
- htop to inspect performace
- https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts#option-4-homebrew-fonts for exa icons
- lsof to inspect pids
- kill -9 <pid>  to kill a pid
- fzf for fuzzy search
- TODO alias them to replace DEFAULY COMMANDS



## ü§∑ TODO look into
- hold w, b, e, or j/k to go superfast. Could consider it if I speeeeeeeed up the button delay. 
- lazygit https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit
- use this fzf for completion?? https://github.com/Aloxaf/fzf-tab
- always open tmux when using ff (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdumjiHabhQ&t=5s)
- use fzf for more usecasess https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgG5Jhi_Els
- mimic this worfkflow? https://elijahmanor.com/blog/neovim-tmux
- cool setup https://github.com/AstroNvim/AstroNvim/tree/main/lua/configs or https://elijahmanor.com/blog/neovim-tmux or https://github.com/LunarVim/LunarVim
- tag manaement. does gutentags ds
- terminal alias/worklows
    - utilize htop better to identify 
    - alias for lsof -i tcp:3000 etc. maybe use fzf completion to find open ports? 
    - alias for kill -9 
    - alias for getting own ip adress
- Remove bashrc and bash_profile when i use zsh
- Remove vimrc? or maybe make it super up-to-date without plugins to utilize it on remote servers etc?
- Add script to dynamically create all files and symlinksand settings chmod premissions 
- better at identifying performance by using htop or tiptop 
- how to make first letter become uppercase
- use somethign like this tmux session chooser https://waylonwalker.com/tmux-choose-tree/
- √∏ve p√• nummer
    - Sette vimium til kun nr for √• √∏ve?
- fikse copy to clipboard and remove oscyank

## üí° Currently experimenting with 
- use harpoon quicktoggle more
- keep gitsigns as is or revert to oldschool?
- [use](use) trouble or loclist for error/warnings?
-  use aerial as tagbar alternativ. overrides { and  } but i usually dont use that anywhat
- use <leader>fs to search for functions and symbolds

- 

## üò© Existing painpoints
- zsh  and tmux terminals
    -  cannot use vim commands to edit vims :term commands. It only focus on the end of the input command, not where the cursor is. So the solution here is to try to use harpoon to write most commenly used commands and limit the writing in the .term. see issue at [github](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/8805) 
-  zsh and tmux and neovim terminals not 100% sure on optimal flow
- [‚óã] workflow
    - [‚úì] context switching overhead: to many tabs to keep track of for frontend + server + misc  
    - [‚úó] cannot open random tmux panes
    - [‚úó] ff does not work anymore
- eslint warning does not work properly in placepoint monorepo
- tsx colors not working
- lss.references opens quiqlist
- want to make a selction bord OR in general add "more stuff to surround" at the same time

# üìà Monitoring
- htop or tiptop
    - (cant descide which one to use)
- tmux session monitoring TODO i need this!!!

# üë®üë®üë¶üë¶ Tmux
- can create a server that re-uses buffers. 
- currently i have to 
    - either close and repoen nvim all the time and 'start form frach'
    - have a shitton of tabs etc open

# Swithcing to fish 


# Switching to fish? (see [docs](https://fishshell.com/docs/3.0/tutorial.html))
If you wish to use fish (or any other shell) as your default shell, you need to enter your new shell's executable /usr/local/bin/fish in two places:

- add /usr/local/bin/fish to /etc/shells
- change your default shell with chsh -s to /usr/local/bin/fish

You can use the following commands for this:

Add the fish shell /usr/local/bin/fish to /etc/shells with:
`echo /usr/local/bin/fish | sudo tee -a /etc/shells`

Change your default shell to fish with:
`chsh -s /usr/local/bin/fish`

## fisher
We also use `fisher` plugin manager. It is more barebone than `oh-my-fish` and is more like npm where `oh-my-fish` is a actual framework
## fish.fzf
- see documentation [here](https://github.com/PatrickF1/fzf.fish/blob/main/functions/_fzf_configure_bindings_help.fish)
- nice way to show fuzzy search
- used for control-r
- and for displaying the tmux session and file explorer
- instead of piping to ilc fzf we can pipe to `_fzf_wapper` e.g `ls | _fzf_wrapper`
- OR just use the native popup in fzf that the `_fzf_wrapper` by just adding `fzf --border --height=90% --preview-window=wrap --layout=reverse` 

# [Zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide)
- zoxide is a smarter cd comman
- install `brew install zoxide`
- add `zoxide init fish | source` to config.fish
- use z <folder> to go directly to folders you have visited before

# FISH Alot of usefull hints [here](/docs/current/interactive.html)
Especially directory movement
```
Several commands are provided to interact with this directory history:

dirh prints the history

cdh displays a prompt to quickly navigate the history

prevd moves backward through the history. It is bound to Alt+‚Üê

nextd moves forward through the history. It is bound to Alt+‚Üí
```
- `control + l ` clears + repaints the screen
- 
- o

# if path is lost restore by https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15872666/how-to-remove-entry-from-path-on-mac
- export PATH="/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11/bin"

## Fortune |¬†Cowsay
- cool asci drawing.Fortune creates text that we pipe into cowsay
- run by `fortune | cowsay`
- add to fish greeting by configurating `fish/functions/fish_greeting.fish`

## Neofetch
- check out some cool configurations [here](https://github.com/Chick2D/neofetch-themes/blob/main/README.md)
- run by `neofetch`
- configure in `neofetch/config.conf`
 
## Image viewer in shell
- builtin command `qlmanage -p <path>` opens a popup in full-size that can be escaped awy
- e.g `qlmanage -p ~/documents/backgrounds/background.jpegqlmanage`
- we alias this to `img <path>`

## vim-startify
- keeps bookmarks and easy access to reasonly used files and bookmarks
- good for easy acces to dotfiles, work and side-projects

## colros and higlightgroups
- to see all highlilght groups do `:hl`
- to filter based on seach do `:filter /NeoTree/ highlight`
- to change a highlight group do `vim.api.nvim_set_hl(0, 'NeoTreeGitModified', { fg="#5DBBC1" })`

## keyboard speed
- go to `system settings` and make sure the keyboard delays are as fast as possible
