# .dotfiles

**Goal**: Super fast terminal based dev environment 

**Worfklow**:
- go to places i visit less often
    -  could use fuzzy finder
- go to places i go to all the time
    - would expect single key-stroke to get there
- go into editing 

**Must have plugins to note:**
- fzf (for zsh) 
- telescope
- harpoon
- vim-fugitive
- easy-motion


**Note**: Remember that most dotfiles har a place somewhere. Make sure they point/symlink to the links inside this dotfile repo. 
Use the `ln -s <actual existing filepath> <this will point to existing file filepath>` to create a symlink
This must be done for (might be missing some):
- nvim
- vimrc
- zshrc
- .zsh_profile
Also for ll scrips/executable u need to make it executble and giev u access
`chmod u+x filepath`
- 


## ðŸ™‡ Worth remembering
- terminal commands and replacements descibed [here](https://andrew.cloud/blog/dev-setup/)
- exa to replace ls
- bat to replace cat
- fd to replace find (fuzzy search)
- htop to inspect performace
- https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts#option-4-homebrew-fonts for exa icons



## ðŸ¤· TODO look into
- hold w, b, e, or j/k to go superfast. Could consider it if I speeeeeeeed up the button delay. 
- lazygit https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit
- use this fzf for completion?? https://github.com/Aloxaf/fzf-tab

- terminal alias/worklows
    - utilize htop better to identify 
    - alias for lsof -i tcp:3000 etc. maybe use fzf completion to find open ports? 
    - alias for kill -9 
    - alias for getting own ip adress
- Remove bashrc and bash_profile when i use zsh
- Remove vimrc? or maybe make it super up-to-date without plugins to utilize it on remote servers etc?
- Add script to dynamically create all files and symlinksand settings chmod premissions 
- better at identifying performance by using htop or tiptop 
- how to make first letter become uppercase
- use somethign like this tmux session chooser https://waylonwalker.com/tmux-choose-tree/

## ðŸ’¡ Currently experimenting with 
- use harpoon quicktoggle more
- keep gitsigns as is or revert to oldschool?
- [use](use) trouble or loclist for error/warnings?
-  use aerial as tagbar alternativ. overrides { and  } but i usually dont use that anywhat
- use <leader>fs to search for functions and symbolds

## ðŸ˜© Existing painpoints
- zsh  and tmux terminals
    -  cannot use vim commands to edit vims :term commands. It only focus on the end of the input command, not where the cursor is. So the solution here is to try to use harpoon to write most commenly used commands and limit the writing in the .term. see issue at [github](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/8805) 
-  zsh and tmux and neovim terminals not 100% sure on optimal flow
- [â—‹] workflow
    - [âœ“] context switching overhead: to many tabs to keep track of for frontend + server + misc  
    - [âœ—] cannot open random tmux panes
    - [âœ—] ff does not work anymore
- eslint warning does not work properly in placepoint monorepo
- tsx colors not working
- lss.references opens quiqlist
- want to make a selction bord OR in general add "more stuff to surround" at the same time

# ðŸ“ˆ Monitoring
- htop or tiptop
    - (cant descide which one to use)
- tmux session monitoring TODO i need this!!!

# ðŸ‘¨ðŸ‘¨ðŸ‘¦ðŸ‘¦ Tmux
- can create a server that re-uses buffers. 
- currently i have to 
    - either close and repoen nvim all the time and 'start form frach'
    - have a shitton of tabs etc open
